## [Visualizing Traffic Conditions Based on Radio Traffic News](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-traffic-conditions-based-on-radio-traffic-news-67e63eee58b3)
![traffic news map](https://miro.medium.com/max/2736/1*GEMfVemN6UfmMQBj0AboQw.png)

In this project, I used a Python library called [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scraping the traffic news from RTHK radio website. Categories of different traffic news such as congestion, accident, busy, blocked, etc. and the location are extracted from the text. Geolocation info is queried using [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
